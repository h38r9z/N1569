Financial   Risk   Management
There   are   FIVE   questions   and   each   has   FOUR   parts.    Each   part   carries   5   marks.
Each   question   should   take   you   24   minutes,   so   6   minutes   per   part.
1.          (a)    You   want   to   measure   the   market   risk   of   a   portfolio   containing   hundreds   of   cash
flows. How   would   you   select   the   risk   factors,   and   how   would   you   map   the   cash   flows   to   these   risk   factors?
(b)    Given   the   15-month   interest   rate   is   3.5%   per   annum   and   it   has   a   volatility   of   60
basis   points   (bps),   find   the   present   value   (PV)   and   the   present   value   of   a   basis   point   (PV01)   of   a   cash   flow   of   $3m   15   months   from   now.   Justify   your   answers.
(c)    Use   the   appropriate      Excel   workbook   to   map   this   cash   flow   to   vertices   at   1   and   2
years,   in   such   a   way   that   both   PV   and   volatility   are   preserved   under   the   mapping.
You   are   given   that   the   1-year   rate   is   4%   and   has   volatility   65   bps,   the   2-year   rate   is 3%   and   has   volatility   50   bps,   and   the   correlation   between   the   1-year   and   2-year   rates   is   0.9.   Justify   your   answer.
(d)    Use   the   appropriate    Excel   workbook   to   calculate   the   present   value   of   a   basis   point   (PV01)   of the   mapped   cash   flows   in   part   (c)   and   comment   o代 写N1569 Financial Risk ManagementJava

2.          (a)    Which   model   would   you   use   to   measure   Value-at-Risk   (VaR)   for   an   equity   portfolio   and   why?
(b)    What   issues   would   you   expect   to   arise   from   this   choice,   if   any?
(c)    Calculate   the   1%   daily   historical   VaR   of the   SP500   index   using   daily   returns
between   1   January   2010   and   31   December   2023.    How   does   this   compare   with   the   normal   VaR?   Give   your   answers   as   a   %   of   the   portfolio   value.
(d)    Scale   this   1%   daily   VaR   to   a   10-day   VaR   under   the   assumption   that   the   daily returns   on   the   SP   500   are   independent   and   identically   distributed.   Would   the   scaled   VaR   remain   unchanged   if you   were   to   assume   the   daily   returns   were   positively   autocorrelated?   Justify   your   answer.
3.          (a)    What   is   Value   at   Risk   (VaR)?   Describe   its   parameters.
(b)    Describe   the   purpose   of the Excel   spreadsheet “Rolling    Normal   VaR”
(c)    Change   the   spreadsheet   so   that   the   30-day   standard   deviation   is   replaced   by   a 10-day   standard   deviation,   leaving   the   VaR   parameters   unchanged.    Describe   the   effect   on   the   graph   and   explain   why   we   observe   this   effect.
(d)    Describe   the   purpose   of the   “VaR      Model   Comparison"   spreadsheet   and   discuss   the   results   therein.
